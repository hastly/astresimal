AnotherCopy / The astroneer way

I can waste the whole time of the Universe waving my hands at you, out of hopes for dissolving, immersing sugar in the pain. Right into the pain.

Then I can have all the gardens re-decorated up to season for the first time in their life that follows the imminent, praising your smile, giving the eternety the happines of having your voice as a gift. And the eternety craving for such kind of privilege i have no doubt. No doubt at all.

The train of the most innocent and never the less the most craziest thoughts still fiercing the clouds, occupied by the heroes, still picking the cherries out of obnoxious mind. Out of the mind.

And the next thing you see will be the wing-spread of the globe-eyed butterfly, that grabs you by heart-beat lifting up into the thin air where all the possible fragile addictions come to the end. Definitely come to the end.

Have you looked out of those shuttered eyes, that see nothing but glittering shimmer of childish fantasies so glazingly tint? Glazingly tinted and what's more obliged to shine. Strictly obliged to shine.

Not the right thing to dream of but the most preferrable to obtain is to have all the seasons well-mixed and available right at your hands. Right at your tireless hands.

Stirred iconically cream of the living inside of believable at the edge of the speakable leave no desire to making amends. Making them.

Stretch up to the stars another copy of you!
