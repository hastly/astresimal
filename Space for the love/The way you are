No words I can desire
Description is yourself
Stop talking start admire
The senses of the elf 

You give them all the matter 
Turn everything around
Like star and even better
And burn them to the ground

I love the way you are
I care the way you walk
You smile before you talk
Light's dancing where you are

That's dream is gonna last
Until the river flows
Into another past
That hides the drowned ghost

The time is gonna come
That turns you in a new self
Still dancing to the old drum
But on another shelf

I love the way you are
I care the way you walk
You smile before you talk
Light's dancing where you are

But while you close to touch
Reach out to feel the beat
No shouts would be too much
To keep the sparklings lit

And everything that shines
And everything that hurts
And everything we sign
Got something when it gots

I love the way you are
I care the way you walk
You smile before you talk
Light's dancing where you are
